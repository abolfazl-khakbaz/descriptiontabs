          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>
            Web design involves creating the visual elements and layout of a
            website, while coding involves translating these designs into a
            functional website using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Typically, dedicated web developers translate the designs
            to code.

          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer
            which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of
            programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which
            humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a
            language computers can understand.

          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable
            computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the
            ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language,
            analyze data, make recommendations, and more.

          <h2>Hack and Pen test</h2>
          <p>
            Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking: Is
            an advanced, offensive form of security testing designed to provide a
            deep technical analysis of a target environment's vulnerability to
            exploitation and attack. Goes beyond basic risk assessment and
            automated techniques.
